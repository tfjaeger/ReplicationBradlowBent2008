Mostly in the beginning I had a hard time understanding what every word was. This has taken me 30 minutes to complete excluding the questions after the transcribing, I am hoping there is some bonus included. I am not sure how someone that is and only speaks english would be able to complete this with 100% focus in 15 minutes or less. If they are, I feel that the data you get from those workers will be junk. I do type fast, I took the study very seriously as I do with all my work. I think for those who really put the effort in to provide good honest data should be paid more. 	1Acc_Same1Acc		India or somewhere located in the middle east. 	monolingual	I am a native American English speaker.
