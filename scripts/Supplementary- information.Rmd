 + SHOULD POSTERIOR SAMPLES BE WEIGHTED BY LOG-P?
 + CHECK WHETHER SET COULD MAYBE ACCOUNT FOR BY-TEST TALKER DIFFERENCES.
 + CHECK WHAT COEFFICIENT ONE WOULD GET BY FITTING TEST DATA FROM BOTH EXPERIMENTS (PERHAPS SEPARATELY BY CONDITION) PREDICED FROM INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN TRAINING, AND THEN USE THAT COEFFICIENT FOR OFFSET.

# README FIRST
This markdown document presents all analyses reported in the paper, and provides additional tables, visualization, and analyses. We have intentionally *not* set a random seed for our analyses. Thus, the specific numbers for the Bayesian models might differ from those reported in the paper. Over the course of our analysis, we conducted all analyses repeatedly and never noticed changes in the qualitative results.

**Note that the analyses in this markdown document might take several days to complete.**

We begin by reporting basic information about participants and item balancing, demographics and audio equipment. We then present analyses of the training and test data, including full reports of all models referred to in the main text of the paper, as well as auxiliary analyses that support the conclusions offered in the main text.

# Participant and item counts by conditions

## Participants across experiments (after exclusions)

### Pilot experiment
```{r number of subjects, echo=F}
d.pilot %>% 
  filter(PartOfExp == "test") %>%
  group_by(Condition2, TestTalkerID, Experiment) %>% 
  distinct(WorkerID) %>%
  xtabs(~TestTalkerID + Condition2 + Experiment, .)
```

### Experiments 1a and 1b

Level at which had to balance both experiments (unique combinations of exposure condition and test talker):
```{r}
d.exp1ab %>% 
  filter(PartOfExp == "test") %>%
  group_by(Condition2, TestTalkerName, Experiment) %>% 
  distinct(WorkerID) %>%
  xtabs(~TestTalkerName + Condition2 + Experiment, .)
```

All unique combinations of exposure condition, exposure talker order, and test talker (i.e., all experimental lists). The order of exposure talkers (only relevant in the control and multi-talker conditions) was randomized. 

Experiment 1a:

```{r}
d.exp1a %>%
  dplyr::select(Condition2, TestTalkerName, TrainingTalkerID, WorkerID) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  xtabs(~ TrainingTalkerID + TestTalkerName + Condition2, data = .)
```

Experiment 1b:

```{r}
d.exp1b %>%
  dplyr::select(Condition2, TestTalkerName, TrainingTalkerID, WorkerID) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  xtabs(~ TrainingTalkerID + TestTalkerName + Condition2, data = .)
```

## Keywords per participants across experiments (after exclusions)

```{r keywords per subject, echo=F}
d.pilot %>% 
  group_by(Experiment, Condition2, TrainingTestSet, WorkerID, PartOfExp) %>% 
  summarise(NumOfKeywords = length(WorkerID)) %>%
  group_by(Experiment, TrainingTestSet, Condition2, PartOfExp) %>% 
  summarise(MeanNumOfKeywords = mean(NumOfKeywords))

d.exp1ab %>% 
  group_by(Experiment, Condition2, TrainingTestSet, WorkerID, PartOfExp) %>% 
  summarise(NumOfKeywords = length(WorkerID)) %>%
  group_by(Experiment, TrainingTestSet, Condition2, PartOfExp) %>% 
  summarise(MeanNumOfKeywords = mean(NumOfKeywords))
```

## Demographics of participants

```{r demographic information}
myXtabs = function (formula, data) { print(round(prop.table(xtabs(formula = formula, data = data), margin = 2), 2)); cat("\n\n") }
# Participant gender distribution
d.exp1ab %>% 
  filter(PartOfExp == "test") %>%
  group_by(Condition2, TestTalkerID, Experiment, 
           Answer.rsrb.age, Answer.rsrb.race, Answer.rsrb.sex, Answer.rsrb.raceother, Answer.rsrb.ethnicity) %>% 
  distinct(WorkerID) %T>%
  myXtabs( ~ Answer.rsrb.sex + Experiment, .) %T>%
  myXtabs( ~ Answer.rsrb.race + Experiment, .) %T>%
  myXtabs( ~ Answer.rsrb.ethnicity + Experiment, .) %>%
  group_by(Experiment) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(
    meanAge = mean(Answer.rsrb.age, na.rm = T),
    sdAge = sd(Answer.rsrb.age, na.rm = T),
    declined = length(which(is.na(Answer.rsrb.age))) / length(Answer.rsrb.age)
  )
```

## Audio equipment

```{r audio information}
d.exp1ab %>%
  group_by(Condition2, Experiment) %>% 
  distinct(WorkerID, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  xtabs(~ Condition2 + AudioType2_WoreHeadphones + Experiment, .)
#xtabs(~ TalkerID + Condition2 + TestTalkerID + ListNum + TrainingTestSet,.) #To find what to balance
```






# Performance during exposure phase in Experiments 1a and 1b

```{r}
select_training = . %>%
  filter(PartOfExp == "training") %>%
  defineContrasts() %>%
  mutate(
    Quintile = as.numeric(cut(Trial, breaks = 5, labels = seq(1,5))) - 1,
    sQuintile = Quintile / 2*sd(Quintile))

select_test = . %>%
  filter(PartOfExp == "test") %>%
  defineContrasts()
  
# Split training and test data for Experiments 1a and 1b
d.exp1a.training = d.exp1a %>% select_training()
d.exp1b.training = d.exp1b %>% select_training()
d.exp1ab.training = 
  rbind(d.exp1a.training,
        d.exp1b.training) %>%
  defineContrasts() %>%
  mutate(Experiment = factor(Experiment, levels = c("1a", "1b")))
contrasts(d.exp1ab.training$Experiment) = cbind("1a vs. 1b" = c(.5,-.5))

d.exp1a.test = d.exp1a %>% select_test()
d.exp1b.test = d.exp1b %>% select_test()
```

Overall performance during exposure was rather comparable in Experiments 1a and 1b, as shown in the following figure. However, performance during the earliest exposure blocks was higher in Experiment 1b, compared to 1a, for the multi-talker and control conditions. What these two these two exposure conditions have in common is that they involve five exposure talkers, rather than one (for the same total number of stimuli), and thus more heterogenous stimuli. Performance was lower in Experiment 1b, compared to 1a, in the other two conditions, though these differences were smaller compared to the relative increase in performance in the control and multi-talker condition.

```{r, comparison exp1a exp1b}
myGplot.defaults(type = "paper")
d.exp1ab.training %>%
  group_by(WorkerID, Sentence) %>%
  distinct(.keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(Experiment, WorkerID, Condition2, Quintile) %>%
	dplyr::summarise(PropKeywordsCorrect = mean(PropKeywordsCorrect)) %>%
	ggplot(aes(x = Quintile + 1, y = PropKeywordsCorrect, colour = Condition2, fill = Condition2, shape = Experiment)) +
  	stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot, geom = "pointrange", position = position_dodge(.5))+

                        guide = F) +
    scale_fill_manual("Exposure Condition", 
                      values = setNames(colors.exposure, 
                                        levels.exposure), 
                      guide = F) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0.75,1.0)) +
    facet_grid(. ~ Condition2) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom", panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())

ggsave(filename = "../figures/p.exp1ab.training.pdf", device = cairo_pdf, width = 6, height = 4.2, dpi=300)
```

This was also confirmed in a Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression over the combined exposure data from both experiments, predicting transcription accuracy during exposure as a function of experiment (sum-coded: -1 = Experiment 1a vs. 1 = Experiment 1b), the exposure condition (sliding difference-coded comparing the talker-specific condition against the multi-talker condition, the multi-talker condition against the single talker condition, and the single talker condition against the control), the trial bin (coded from 0 to 4 for the five blocks of 16 sentence recordings during exposure), and their interactions. Additionally, the model contained random intercepts by subject, item, and the current exposure talker, as well as random slopes for exposure condition by item, and random slopes for trial bin by participant. The results are summarized and visualized below.

## Potential consequences of individual differences in *a priori* performance

It is possible that differences in performance during exposure reflect difference in the audio equipment between Experiments 1a and 1b. In particular, the proportion of participants who used headsets remained identical betwween Experiments 1a and 1b only for the talker-specific condition. The proportion of participants who used headsets increased most from Experiment 1a to 1b for the control and multi-talker conditions---i.e. precisely those conditions for which performance in Experiment 1b seems higher (during the earliest exposure trials), compared to Experiment 1a. Alternatively (or additionally), it is possible that the differences between the two experiments reflect changes in the population that we are recruiting from (about three years passed between recruitment for Experiment 1a and 1b). This possibility is explores in the section on *Performance across time*.

Whatever the reason for these difference, it is possible that they confound the analyses of the test data. **The analyses of performance during the test phase therefore control for individual differences in performance during exposure**. Specifically, the analyses of the test data use an offset term that is based on the individual difference in performance at the onset of the exposure phase. Next, we describe how we estimated these individual differences.^[Additional analyses previously conducted for Experiment 1a (which had a more asymmetric distribution of audio equipment across exposure conditions, see above) found that results did not change if audio equipment was included as a control predictor in the analyses.]


## Estimating individual differences in performance at the onset of exposure

Our goal was to estimate each individual's performance at the onset of the experiment, before effects of exposure could cause additional individual differences. This, we hope, can capture differences in quality of the audio equipment, differences in the degree to which participants paid attention, etc. We thus fit a Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression, predicting transcription accuracy during exposure as a function of the exposure condition (*control*, *single talker*, *multi-talker*, and *talker-specific*), the trial bin (from 0 to 4 for the five blocks of 16 sentence recordings during exposure), and their interaction. Additionally, the model contained random intercepts by subject, item, and the current exposure talker, as well as random slopes for exposure condition by item, and random slopes for trial bin by participant. Critically, the model did not contain a predictor for experiment since we are interested in capturing individual differences in participants' performance across the entire sample of participants in Experiments 1a and 1b.

In this model, the random intercept by participant provide an estimate of each participants' performance *relative to other participants in the same exposure group* (since exposure condition was included in the model) *during the first trial bin* (since the first trial bin is coded as 0). These random by-participant intercepts are then used as an offset in the analysis of the test data.

```{r}
# Model without experiment as predictor
m.brm.exp1ab.train = brm(IsCorrect ~ Cond.diff * sQuintile +
                           (1 + Cond.diff | Sentence) + (1 + sQuintile | WorkerID) + (1 | CurrentTalkerID), 
                         data = d.exp1ab.training, 
                         family = bernoulli, cores = max.cores, chains = 4, 
                         warmup = 2000, iter = 4000, 
                         prior = my.priors, file = "../models/exp1ab.Training.diff")
plot(conditional_effects(m.brm.exp1ab.train, 
                         # set to NULL to add uncertainty about all random effects
                         re_formula = NA), ask = F)
```




## How do our modeling assumptions affect the estimates of individual differences?

```{r add individual training performance to training and test data}
## Extract random by-subject intercepts from the various models
get_random_intercepts = function(model) {
  ranef(model)[["WorkerID"]][,,"Intercept"] %>%
    as_tibble(rownames = "WorkerID") %>%
    dplyr::select(WorkerID, Estimate)
}

d.training.individual_performance = 
  m.brm.exp1ab.train %>%
  get_random_intercepts() %>%
  rename(individual_training_performance.linear = Estimate) %>%
  left_join(
    m.brm.exp1ab.train.monotonic %>%
    get_random_intercepts() %>%
    rename(individual_training_performance.monotonic = Estimate)
  ) %>%
  left_join(
    m.brm.exp1ab.train.wExperiment %>%
    get_random_intercepts() %>%
    rename(individual_training_performance.linear.wExperiment = Estimate)
  ) 

# Join individual training performance back into data frames
add_individual_performance = . %>%
  left_join(d.training.individual_performance) %>%
  defineContrasts() %>% 
  standardize()

d.exp1ab.training = 
  rbind(d.exp1a.training, d.exp1b.training) %>%
  add_individual_performance()
d.exp1a.training %<>% add_individual_performance()
d.exp1b.training %<>% add_individual_performance()

d.exp1ab.test = 
  rbind(d.exp1a.test, d.exp1b.test) %>%
  add_individual_performance()
d.exp1a.test %<>% add_individual_performance()
d.exp1b.test %<>% add_individual_performance()
```

### Pooling of data across experiments without controlling for effects of experiment

We first compared the estimates of individual differences against estimates derived from the full model that additionally contained experiment as a predictor, as well as its interaction with trial bin and exposure condition. The goal of this comparison is to see how our decision to *not* include experiment in the estimation of individual differences affects the estimated individual differences. The black shapes show the mean across participants in that condition and experiment.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=7}
d.exp1ab.test %>%
  dplyr::select(Experiment, WorkerID, Condition2, starts_with("individual_training_performance")) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(Experiment, WorkerID, Condition2) %>%
  dplyr::summarise_at(vars(starts_with("individual_training_performance")), mean) %>%
  { . ->> temp } %>%
ggplot(aes(x = individual_training_performance.linear, y = individual_training_performance.linear.wExperiment, shape = Experiment, color = Experiment)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_point(data = temp %>%
         group_by(Experiment, Condition2) %>%
         dplyr::summarise_all(mean),
         size = 3, alpha = 1, color = "black"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous("by-participant adjustment from linear model") +
  scale_y_continuous("by-participant adjustment from linear model + experiment") +
  facet_wrap(~ Condition2)

cat("Zooming in ...\n")
last_plot() + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-.5, .5), ylim = c(-.5, .5))
```

### Assuming linear effects of exposure 

Finally, the model we used above to estimate individual differences at the onset of exposure assumes that effect of increasing exposure (trial bins) on the log-odds of accurate transcriptions are linear. To ascertain that this linearity assumption does not introduce undue bias to the estimation of the effects at the beginning of the experiment, we also fit a model that did only assume monotonicity of the changes across qunitiles, rather than the stronger qssumption of linearity (in log-odds). This model makes a very similar predictions for the effects during exposure:

```{r}
m.brm.exp1ab.train.monotonic = brm(IsCorrect ~ Cond.diff * mo(Quintile) +
                           (1 + Cond.diff | Sentence) + (1 + mo(Quintile) | WorkerID) + (1 | CurrentTalkerID), 
                         data = d.exp1ab.training, 
                         family = bernoulli, cores = max.cores, chains = 4, 
                         warmup = 2000, iter = 4000, 
                         prior = my.priors, file = "../models/exp1ab.Training.diff.monotonic")
plot(conditional_effects(m.brm.exp1ab.train.monotonic, 
                         # set to NULL to add uncertainty about all random effects
                         re_formula = NA), ask = F)
```

Critically, there is no evidence that the linearity assumption causes any bias in the estimation of individual differences, compared to the model that merely assumes monotonicity. The two models provide *very similar* estimates of participants' performance during the first exposure block:

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=7}
d.exp1ab.test %>%
  dplyr::select(Experiment, WorkerID, Condition2, starts_with("individual_training_performance")) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(Experiment, WorkerID, Condition2) %>%
  dplyr::summarise_at(vars(starts_with("individual_training_performance")), mean) %>%
  { . ->> temp } %>%
ggplot(aes(x = individual_training_performance.linear, y = individual_training_performance.monotonic, shape = Experiment, color = Experiment)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_point(data = temp %>%
         group_by(Experiment, Condition2) %>%
         dplyr::summarise_all(mean),
         size = 3, alpha = 1, color = "black"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous("by-participant adjustment from linear model") +
  scale_y_continuous("by-participant adjustment from monotonic model") +
  facet_wrap(~ Condition2)

cat("Zooming in ...\n")
last_plot() + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-.5, .5), ylim = c(-.5, .5))
```

In the remainder of the analyses, we thus used the linear model because it is more common and readers are more familiar with it. Given the high similarity in the estimates, we never investigated whether individual differences based on the monotonic model would change any of the results for the test data.

## Predicting individual difference during test from individual differences during training

In the analyses of the test data, we discount for the individual differences in performance at the onset of test. We do so by using the random by-participant intercept from the linear model as **offset** in the mixed-effects logistic regression of the test data. It was therefore important to test whether individual differences during exposure actually predict individual differences during test. To this end, we fit a Bayesian mixed-effect logistic regression, predicting accuracy during test as a function of the individual differences estimated from the linear model. The model also contained random intercepts by participant and item. This revealed a very strong effect of individual differences during exposure on performance during test.

```{r}
# SDs
d.exp1ab.test %>%
  summarise_at(vars(starts_with("individual_training_performance")), function(x) 2 * sd(x))

nsamples.warmup = 2000
nsamples.total = 4000

# Let's scale continuous variables to have SD .5 (i.e. divide through 2 SDs) and set mean to maximally 
# ambiguous continuum step (rather than center). Binary factors should be coded to have level-
# distance of 1. Then we follow https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations 
# and set the scale of the our t-prior to 2.5
my.priors = c(
    # Following Gelman et al (2008) and later revisions on wiki.
    # First parameter is DFs: smaller means fatter (less normal) tails. 
    # Second parameter is mu: should be 0 to be unbiased
    # Third parameter is sigma: larger means wider
    prior(student_t(3,0,2.5), class = b),
    # 5 is a common choice for logit models. Consider using a stronger prior if convergence is an issue
    prior(cauchy(0,5), class = sd)
    # ,

m.exp1ab.test.fromTraining <- brm(IsCorrect ~ 
                           1 + individual_training_performance.linear_s +
                           (1 | Sentence) + (1 | WorkerID),  
                         data = d.exp1ab.test %>% standardize(), 
                         family = bernoulli, cores = 4, chains = 4, 
                         warmup = nsamples.warmup, iter = nsamples.total, 
                         prior = my.priors, file = "../models/exp1ab.Test.fromIndividualTrainingDifferences")
hypothesis(m.exp1ab.test.fromTraining, "individual_training_performance.linear_s > 0")
```
The effect of this predictor can also be seen in the reduction of the variability in the by-participant random intercepts during test in the model that controlled for individual differences in performance (SD = .60):

```{r}
summary(m.exp1ab.test.fromTraining)
```

compared to a model that did not (SD = .74): 

```{r}
# Estimate the by-subject variance during test if performance at onset of training is *not* taken into account:
m.exp1ab.test.justIntercept <- brm(IsCorrect ~ 
                           1 + 
                           (1 | Sentence) + (1 | WorkerID),  
                         data = d.exp1ab.test %>% standardize(), 
                         family = bernoulli, cores = 4, chains = 4, 
                         warmup = nsamples.warmup, iter = nsamples.total, 
                         prior = my.priors[-1,], file = "../models/exp1ab.Test.justIntercept")
summary(m.exp1ab.test.justIntercept)
```
In other words, individual differences in performance during training relative to other participants that see the same exposure materials are indeed highly predictive of individual differences in performance during test. This highlights the potential that even small imbalanced in these individual differences across the four conditions in Experiments 1a and 1b could make the test results across the two experiments appear less similar than they are (once individual differences are taken into account).

If we translate the estimated coefficient back into the un-standardized individual differences at the onset of the exposure block (`individual_training_performance.linear`) this yields the following estimates for the relation of individual differences in performance at the onset of training and the performance during test:

```{r}
d.exp1ab.test %>%
  dplyr::select(individual_training_performance.linear) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(starts_with("individual_training_performance")), function(x) 2 * sd(x)) %>%
  as.numeric() %>%
  (function(x) summary(m.exp1ab.test.fromTraining)$fixed[2,c(1,3:4)] / x)
```

In the analysis of the test data, we thus include the individual differences in performance at the onset of exposure as an offset term. This sets the coefficient of this effect to 1, higher than the effect observed here. We did so based on the *a priori* consideration that the task during test is the same as during exposure so that any individual differences in the log-odds of accurate transcriptions during exposure (compared to other participants who heard the exact same stimuli) should translate to the exact same difference in log-odds of accurate transcriptions during test.

# Test - Experiment 1a

In order to address the three questions we ask in the main text (Table 1), we need to compare test performance between the multi-talker and control condition (*Question 1: Is there cross-talker generalization after multi-talker exposure?*), between the single talker and control condition (*Question 2: Is there cross-talker generalization after single talker exposure?*), and the multi-talker and single talker condition (*Question 3: Does multi-talker exposure facilitate cross-talker generalization, compared to single talker exposure?*). 

To achieve these comparisons, we use `brm()` from the `brms` package to fit Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression to the test data, predicting the accuracy of participants' responses from the four exposure conditions (control, single talker, multi-talker, talker-specific), and the control predictor for individual differences (see main text for details). The random effect structure was maximal, i.e., random intercepts by subject and item, as well as random slopes for the exposure condition by item (since exposure condition was manipulated between subjects, no by subject slopes were included).

All hypothesis tests reported in the paper are based on a model that uses sliding difference-coding for the the exposure conditions. The *sliding difference-coded model* imposes an order among the four conditions (control < single talker < multi-talker < talker-specific exposure), and compares each condition against the next 'lower' condition. The first contrast compares the single talker against the control condition. The second contrast compares the multi-talker against the single talker condition. The third contrast compares the talker-specific against the multi-talker condition. This coding has the advantage the resulting predictors are orthogonal to each other (unlike for, e.g., treatment-coding). The `hypothesis()` function of the `brms` package makes it easy to test hypotheses about sums of effects. For example, the Bayesian hypothesis test for our first question (*Is there cross-talker generalization after multi-talker exposure?*) asks whether the sum of the single talker vs. control effect (resulting from the first sliding difference-coded contrast) plus the multi-talker vs. single talker effect (resulting from the second sliding difference-coded contrast) is larger than zero. The test for our second question (*Is there cross-talker generalization after single talker exposure?*) asks whether the single talker vs. control effect by itself is larger than zero. The test for our third question (*Is there cross-talker generalization after single talker exposure?*) asks whether the multi-talker vs. single talker effect (resulting from the third sliding difference-coded contrast) is larger than zero. And, finally, the hypothesis test for the talker-specific effect---provided for comparison, as it is has been replicated many times across studies---ask whether the sum of all three sliding difference-coded contrasts is larger than zero.

Since some readers might be more familiar with treatment-coding, we also present a *treatment-coded model* that compares each condition against the control condition as baseline. The first contrast compares the talker-specific condition against the control. The second contrast compares the multi-talker condition against the control. The third contrast compares the single-talker condition against the control. The treatment-coded model differed from the sliding difference-coded model only in terms of the contrasts employed for the exposure conditions.

We first present the result summary for the three questions of interest. These are the results presented in the main text. Then we we present the complete model output and additional Bayesian hypothesis tests for both the difference- and treatment-coded models.

# Consequences of by-talker variability

Unlike the original study by Bradlow and Bent (2008), our replication included multiple (4) test talkers and many exposure-test talker combinations (20 for the single talker condition, 4 each for the control, multi-talker and talker-specific conditions). This allows us to begin to assess the consequences of cross-talker variability on the effects of exposure. We present additional analyses that account for cross-talker differences, allowing us to assess whether our conclusions would differ if Experiments 1a and 1b had only used a subset of the exposure and test talkers. In particular, we ask two questions:

 + Can *limiting the experiment to one test talker* change the results, compared to having four test talkers?
 + Can *failing to balance the exposure talkers* across the single and multi-talker conditions (as in Bradlow and Bent, 2008) change the results, compared to fully balanced lists (as in the present experiments)? 

We address these questions through additional Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression, repeating the analyses presented in the main text while including random effects by test talker or exposure-test talker combination. These analyses reveal substantial quantitative---though, at least for our relatively homogenous set of talkers, not *necessarily* qualitative---variability in ou results, depending on the exposure and test talkers. As would be expected, this variability is particularly evident for the single talker and talker-specific conditions, the conditions for which exposure involved only a single talker. In particular, the effect of single talker exposure can vary *qualitatively* depending on the combination of exposure and test talker. <!-- CHECK --> 

This highlights the need for future work to either employ stimuli from multiple talkers, or to appropriately caveat the conclusions drawn from experiments that are based on a very small number of talkers. Put differently, it is to be expected that individual experiments---in particular if they are based on only one exposure and/or test talker---will return different results *even if the experiments employ an adequate number of subjects and items*. Such differences in results do not necessarily reflect empirical conflicts, but might quite simply capture that cross-talker generalization is, or is not, observed after exposure to the *particular* combination of exposure and test talkers. This point deserves emhasis, in particular, given the field's reliance on, and frequent misinterpretation of, the notion of significance: this 'significance filter' (Vasishth, 2018) can misleadingly further the impression that results conflict even when effects across pattern in identical ways. To make things worse, apparent qualitative differences in results between experiments---sometimes within the same paper---are not infrequently used to motivate ad-hoc theorizing. The present results suggest that research on speech perception ought to first ask whether differences in results are simply the consequence of using different combinations of talkers.

Next, we assess the degree of *overconfidence* that results from experiments with just one test talker if we fail to consider that the use of a single test talker makes it impossible to account for cross-talker variability. This further illustrates the consequences of the common practice to measure talker-specific adaptation and cross-talker generalization against a single test talker. Specifically, we ask:

 + How much (if at all) do experiments with a single test talker result in *over-confidence in the generalizability of our results* (if we fail to remember that they are based on just one test talker)?  
 
For this, we analyze subsets of our data that only include one test talker with the same approach as in the main text, and compare the uncertainty about the effect of exposure to results based on the same total amount of data from all four test talkers. The results highlight that the use of a single test talker might make it *appear* as if one can be more certain about the results, but that this relative certainty about the effect of exposure is misleading: with one test talker, researchers simply do not know how much the results would vary if multiple test talkers were considered, and thus researchers might feel overconfident that their striking results will generalize to other talkers.

This leads us to the final analysis in thise section. The use of multiple exposure and test talkers also lets us assess the generalizability of our results beyond the specific exposure and test talkers employed in Experiments 1a and 1b. We use the Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regressions with random effects by exposure and test talkers to quantify how much our certainty about the effect of exposure increases if our analyses acknowledge exposure and/or test talkers as sources of random variability. We find, for example, that the standard error for the effect of single talker exposure increases three-fold <!-- CHECK --> if exposure-test talker combinations are acknowledged as a source of random variability. This further illustrates the need for studies on speech perception---and other domains of the psychological sciences that involve social or socially-conditioned inferences---to use stimuli that come from multiple talkers, and analyses that capture this variability adequately.


## Do differences between test talkers affect the conclusions one would draw?

To address our first question:

 + Can *limiting the experiment to one test talker* change the results, compared to having four test talkers?

we fit an additional sliding difference-coded Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regressions to each of Experiment 1a and 1b. The additional analysis added random intercepts and slopes for the exposure conditions by test talkers. We use these models to estimate the effects of exposure by test talker.^[An alternative approach would be to estimate the effect for each test talker by fitting separate models to the data from each test talker. This approach would not use all data and thus have reduced power. Another approach would be to use all data---as we did here---but to model effects of test talkers as fixed effects, interacting with exposure condition. Empirically, this is unlikely to result in different results than the approach taken here. We prefer the approach we pursued here for three reasons. First, it is conceptually appealing, as it views the four test talkers as sampled from a larger population (among which differences in the effect of exposure are assumed to be normally distributed). Second, treating test talkers as random effects essentially imposes a regularizing prior on the by-test talker means, which should reduce the probability of overfitting to the sample (for an accessible discussion of the resulting 'shrinkage' effects, see Kliegl et al., 2010). Third, the approach is parsimonuous in terms of its degrees of freedom: for a random intercept and a three random slopes for the exposure conditions, the resulting 4x4 variance-covariance matrix of the random effects by test talker has 7 DFs (4 variances, and 3 correlations between them). Treating test talker as fixed effect requires 12 DFs = 3 DFs (for the four test talkers) + 3 x 3 DFs (for the interaction with exposure condition). This benefit becomes even more pronounced for variables with more levels, such as the effects of exposure-test talker combinations: for the random effect approach, the number of DFs does not change, whereit it increases linearly with the number of levels for the fixed effect approach.] 

Models were fit with 3000 warm-up and 2000 posterior samples for each of 4 chains, for a total of 8000 posterior samples. The priors were the same as for the main analysis *except that we set a more specific prior for the intercept*: a student $t$ prior with a scale of 2.5, 7 DFs, and a location parameter set to the posterior mean of the main analysis. This was done to aid convergence, since weaker priors resulted in divergent transitions.

### Summary of findings 
It is clear that the specific effects differ between test talkers. For the present data, these differences are comparatively small: we find the same ordering of relative effect sizes across all test talkers, and the posterior probability for a positive answer to Questions 1-3 is always larger than 50%. The similarity of the effect sizes is perhaps not surprising, since we (a) all of the six test talkers we considered in our pilot study were chosen to be of medium proficiency, <!-- Xin: CHECK --> and (b) of those six, we chose the four test talkers that were not close to ceiling after talker-specific adaptation. In short, our test talkers are representive only of a comparatively homogenous subset of the overall population of Mandarin-accented talkers.

However, even for test talkers like these, who are *a priori* expected to be relatively similar to each other, it is also clear that we would have come to at least gradiently different conclusions if we had chosen only one of our four test talkers. <!-- TO DO: continue here with brief summary of results -->

### Experiment 1a
We first quantify how the overall result of exposure differs depending on the test talker. Qualitatively, we find that that, four all four test talkers, the effects of all four comparisons went in the same direction---i.e., exposure always had *positive* effects on comprehension accuracy. We further find the same ordering of effect sizes for the four comparisons of exposure conditions for three out of the four test talkers (for the fourth test talker, the relative effect sizes for questions 2 and 3 order differently). The same holds for ordering of the strength of evidence (Bayes factors).  However, talker-specific adaptation was the only effect that reached *strong* support for all four test talkers. Generalization after multi-talker exposure received strong support for three out of the four test talkers, and positive support on the fourt test talker. Generalization after single talker exposure received strong support for only one out of the four test talkers, and positive support for the other three test talkers. Overall, test talker 032 and 037 showed the strongest effects, and test talker 034 showed the weakest effects.

               scope = "coef", group = "TestTalkerID")
```

Next, we further quantify the difference between the different test talkers. The following hypothesis tests assess whether the effect inferred for a given test talker differs from the overall effect inferred across test talkers. This was never the case for any of the comparisons or any of the test talkers. It is worth noting though that *all* effects were numerically smaller for test talker 043.

```


### Experiment 1b
We first quantify how the overall result of exposure differs depending on the test talker. As in Experiment 1a, exposure always had *positive* effects on comprehension accuracy. The relative effect sizes order the same way as in Experiment 1a for two of the test talkers (032 and 035), but not the other two test talkers. The most striking difference is found for test talker 037, which exhibited the second strongest support for generalization after single talker exposure in Experiment 1a, but only exhibited positive support in Experiment 1b.

```

Next, we further quantify the difference between the different test talkers. The following hypothesis tests assess whether the effect inferred for a given test talker differs from the overall effect inferred across test talkers. As was the case for Experiment 1a, there never was anywhere close to strong evidence that effects for a given test talker differed from the overall effect. For test talker 043, for which all effects were numerically smaller than the average in Experiment 1a, three out of four effects were numerically smaller than the average in Experiment 1b.

## Do differences between exposure-test talker combinations affect the conclusions one would draw?
To address our second question:

 + Can *failing to balance the exposure talkers* across the single and multi-talker conditions (as in Bradlow and Bent, 2008) change the results, compared to fully balanced lists (as in the present experiments)? 

we fit an additional sliding difference-coded Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regressions to each of Experiment 1a and 1b. This analysis further added random intercepts and slopes for the exposure conditions by exposure talker, embedded under test talker. We use these models to estimate the effects of exposure by exposure-test talker combination.

## Uncertainty about posterior effect size estimates based on the random effect structure

We ask how the uncertainty about the effects of exposure changes depending on which grouping factors are acknowledged in the analysis. The analyses reported in the main text followed the conventions of the field in 2020 and included by-subject and -item random effects (Bradlow and Bent, 2008 only included by-subject analyses). However, our experiment included multiple test talkers as well as many exposure-test talker combinations. If we want to know whether the effects of our exposure conditions are likely to generalize across the population of talkers that our exposure and test talkers are drawn from, we arguably need to adequately account for these grouping factors (see Yarkoni, 2019 for discussion).

We thus use the two Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regressions with random effects by test talker and exposure-test talker combinations to measure how the uncertainty about the effect of exposure condition changes if those additional random effects are included in the analysis. 

With each additional source of variability (and thus uncertainty), we see that the uncertainty about the effect of exposure increases. This isn't surprising (for relevant background, see Yarkoni, 2019), but it is still worth noting that these increases are *substantial*: the standard error of the effect of single talker, compared to control, exposure increases almost three- to four-fold when we account for the variability across test talkers. <!-- CHECK whether result still holds -->

# Performance across time (2-3 year span)

Experiments 1a and 1b were run at different times, almost 2 years apart. In both case, we recruited an initial number of participants and then completed to fill up lists until the pre-specified number of participants per condition was reached. This left us with data from participants that had taken the experiment at different times.

# Replication analysis (Add visualization)

Use the previous data to establish a prior. You may want to construct a normal prior centered at their estimate, with a standard deviation equal to their SD (Martin proposed SE) estimate. Do this for every coefficient. Construct two models, WITHOUT using the ~ syntax. You need to use the target += normal_lpdf(…) syntax. (This is because we will need to compute the marginal likelihood, with all normalizing constants present, and the ~ syntax drops those constants). The first model has the full model, with priors defined in step 1. The second model has the reduced model, with the coefficient of interest implicitly set to zero (as in, it isn’t present). Everything else is the same as in the first model. Estimate both models using the replication data.

```{r, set up replication analysis based on bridge sampling}

# Let's scale continuous variables to have SD .5 (i.e. divide through 2 SDs) and set mean to maximally 
# ambiguous continuum step (rather than center). Binary factors should be coded to have level-
# distance of 1. Then we follow https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations

my.priors = c(
    # Following Gelman et al (2008) and later revisions on wiki.
    # First parameter is DFs: smaller means fatter (less normal) tails. As DFs approach, distribution approaches normality
    # Second parameter is mu: should be 0 to be unbiased
    # Third parameter is sigma: larger means wider
    prior(student_t(3,0,2.5), class = b),
    # 5 is a common choice for logit models. Consider using a stronger prior if convergence is an issue
